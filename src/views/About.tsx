        The Music App is designed to provide users with the ability to play
        samples of music from iTunes before making a purchase. It allows users
        to search for songs, albums, and artists and customize their
        preferences. The about page highlights the features of the app, explains
        how it works, and encourages users to get started by signing in to their
        iTunes account.
